        with your replacements strings set on this page. As well as the pre-defined list of codes, you can use data in
        the settings to complete the replacement of these source strings. The replacement string can match the
        programmer replacement code for any string in the settings.  An example is to set the 'this_school' source with
        the organisation name.  To do this, add the setting name between a pair of 3 exclamation marks. The name of any
        setting must return a string value, so to capture the organisation short name use
        &excl;&excl;&excl;org.name.short&excl;&excl;&excl;"
